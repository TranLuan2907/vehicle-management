<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]()

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot3]]()




This project serves as an assignment for the LAB211 - OOP with Java Lab course at FPT University. Students are tasked with applying the Java programming knowledge acquired in the pre-requisite course, PRO192 (Programming OOP with Java), to develop a practical, real-life application.

**In this assignment, I built the project using the <code style='color: cyan'>Stream API</code> and <code style='color: cyan'>Lambda Expressions</code> instead of traditional foreach loops and sorting methods.**

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To run the project, you need to follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

1. Firstly, you need to install JDK (Java Development Kit) which plays an important role in providing necessary tools and libraries to execute the code.

2. After you have downloaded and installed JDK,  you will need to go through the same process with an IDE (Integrated development environment).

There are many IDEs now available on the internet to run Java code, such as VSCode, Eclipse, ... but I highly recommend **Netbeans** or **IntelliJ** due to their stability."

Finally, download this project to your computer, extract it and run with the IDE that you have just installed

In the project, locate the 'VehicleManagementSystem' class. This class serves as the main class and functions as the entry point of the program. Select the 'VehicleManagementSystem' class, run it, and you are good to go!

### Installation

* Click [Here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to download and install the JDK 

* Click [Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) to download and install Intellij IDEA

OR
* Click [Here](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/) to download and install NetBeans

Notice that if you are accustomed to using another IDE not listed here, feel free to use it anyway.
